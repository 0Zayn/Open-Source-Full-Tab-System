# [Open-Source] Blaze - Full Tab System
Full tab system containing all the information you need to start up your new application. This project has now been released, and will be open for all to use and learn from, feel free to use this in your application, and please do not distribute this under your name. I do not want people to use this for materials they will release for paid use, so please do not. Also this is a tutorial for begginers, so dont be lazy and ask for Source Code, I didn't write all this just for people to skip it and go straight to installation without learning anything.

# Setup

To start first create a new folder, in your application and name it ```bin```, next inside that create a folder named ```tabs```
Congratulations, you should now have this:
